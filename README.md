# Gray-Arch

![Setup](/images/setup.png)

## Root Modifications
* `/etc/fstab` with CIFS mounting.
* `/etc/hosts` with domain redirect on LAN (with use with `~/.scripts/init/domain-fix.sh` script).
* `crontab` with starting domain-fix script at boot.
* `~/.config/i3/confg` has literally every other script I use.

## Daily Use
* `newsboat`
* `irssi` (can people please use my IRC server)
* `vivaldi-stable`
* `discord` :sad:
